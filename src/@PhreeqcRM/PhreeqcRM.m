            Abort the program. Result will be interpreted as an IRM_RESULT value and decoded; err_str will be printed; and the reaction module will be destroyed. If using MPI, an MPI_Abort message will be sent before the reaction module is destroyed. If the id is an invalid instance, RM_Abort will return a value of IRM_BADINSTANCE, otherwise the program will exit with a return code of 4.

            Parameters
            id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
            result	Integer treated as an IRM_RESULT return code.
            err_str	String to be printed as an error message.
            Return values
            IRM_RESULT	Program will exit before returning unless id is an invalid reaction module id.

            %{
            N sets of component concentrations are converted to SOLUTIONs numbered 1-n in the Utility IPhreeqc. The solutions can be reacted and manipulated with the methods of IPhreeqc. If solution concentration units (RM_SetUnitsSolution) are per liter, one liter of solution is created in the Utility instance; if solution concentration units are mass fraction, one kilogram of solution is created in the Utility instance. The motivation for this method is the mixing of solutions in wells, where it may be necessary to calculate solution properties (pH for example) or react the mixture to form scale minerals. The code fragments below make a mixture of concentrations and then calculate the pH of the mixture.

            Parameters
            id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
            c	Array of concentrations to be made SOLUTIONs in Utility IPhreeqc. Array storage is equivalent to Fortran (n,ncomps).
            n	The number of sets of concentrations.
            tc	Array of temperatures to apply to the SOLUTIONs, in degree C. Array of size n.
            p_atm	Array of pressures to apply to the SOLUTIONs, in atm. Array of size n.

            Returns an IPhreeqc id for the ith IPhreeqc instance in the reaction module.

            For the threaded version, there are nthreads + 2 IPhreeqc instances, where nthreads is defined in the constructor (RM_Create). The number of threads can be determined by RM_GetThreadCount. The first nthreads (0 based) instances will be the workers, the next (nthreads) is the InitialPhreeqc instance, and the next (nthreads + 1) is the Utility instance. Getting the IPhreeqc pointer for one of these instances allows the user to use any of the IPhreeqc methods on that instance. For MPI, each process has exactly three IPhreeqc instances, one worker (number 0), one InitialPhreeqc instance (number 1), and one Utility instance (number 2).

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.

Phreeqc allows multiple selected-output definitions, each of which is assigned a nonnegative integer identifier by the user. The number of definitions can be obtained by RM_GetSelectedOutputCount. To cycle through all of the definitions, RM_GetNthSelectedOutputUserNumber can be used to identify the user number for each selected-output definition in sequence. RM_SetCurrentSelectedOutputUserNumber is then used to select that user number for selected-output processing.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                n	The sequence number of the selected-output definition for which the user number will be returned. C, 0 based.

        function [status, sat_out] = RM_GetSaturation(obj, sat_calc)
            %{
            Returns a vector of saturations (sat) as calculated by the reaction module. Reactions will change the volume of solution in a cell. The transport code must decide whether to ignore or account for this change in solution volume due to reactions. Following reactions, the cell saturation is calculated as solution volume (RM_GetSolutionVolume) divided by the product of representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume) and the porosity (RM_SetPorosity). The cell saturation returned by RM_GetSaturation may be less than or greater than the saturation set by the transport code (RM_SetSaturation), and may be greater than or less than 1.0, even in fully saturated simulations. Only the following databases distributed with PhreeqcRM have molar volume information needed to accurately calculate solution volume and saturation: phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                sat_calc	Vector to receive the saturations. Dimension of the array is set to nxyz, where nxyz is the number of user grid cells (RM_GetGridCellCount). Values for inactive cells are set to 1e30.

        function sat = GetSaturation(obj)
            %{
            Returns a vector of saturations (sat) as calculated by the reaction module. Reactions will change the volume of solution in a cell. The transport code must decide whether to ignore or account for this change in solution volume due to reactions. Following reactions, the cell saturation is calculated as solution volume (RM_GetSolutionVolume) divided by the product of representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume) and the porosity (RM_SetPorosity). The cell saturation returned by RM_GetSaturation may be less than or greater than the saturation set by the transport code (RM_SetSaturation), and may be greater than or less than 1.0, even in fully saturated simulations. Only the following databases distributed with PhreeqcRM have molar volume information needed to accurately calculate solution volume and saturation: phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                sat_calc	Vector to receive the saturations. Dimension of the array is set to nxyz, where nxyz is the number of user grid cells (RM_GetGridCellCount). Values for inactive cells are set to 1e30.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.

            Return values

                c, n_boundary, boundary_solution1, boundary_solution2, fraction1)
            %{
            Fills an array (c) with concentrations from solutions in the InitialPhreeqc instance. The method is used to obtain concentrations for boundary conditions. If a negative value is used for a cell in boundary_solution1, then the highest numbered solution in the InitialPhreeqc instance will be used for that cell. Concentrations may be a mixture of two solutions, boundary_solution1 and boundary_solution2, with a mixing fraction for boundary_solution1 1 of fraction1 and mixing fraction for boundary_solution2 of (1 - fraction1). A negative value for boundary_solution2 implies no mixing, and the associated value for fraction1 is ignored. If boundary_solution2 and fraction1 are NULL, no mixing is used; concentrations are derived from boundary_solution1 only.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                c	Array of concentrations extracted from the InitialPhreeqc instance. The dimension of c is equivalent to Fortran allocation (n_boundary, ncomp), where ncomp is the number of components returned from RM_FindComponents or RM_GetComponentCount.
                n_boundary	The number of boundary condition solutions that need to be filled.
                boundary_solution1	Array of solution index numbers that refer to solutions in the InitialPhreeqc instance. Size is n_boundary.
                boundary_solution2	Array of solution index numbers that that refer to solutions in the InitialPhreeqc instance and are defined to mix with boundary_solution1. Size is n_boundary. May be NULL in C.
                fraction1	Fraction of boundary_solution1 that mixes with (1-fraction1) of boundary_solution2. Size is (n_boundary). May be NULL in C. 
            C Example:

                nbound = 1;
                bc1 = (int *) malloc((size_t) (nbound * sizeof(int)));
                bc2 = (int *) malloc((size_t) (nbound * sizeof(int)));

                initial_conditions1, initial_conditions2, fraction1)
            %{
            Transfer solutions and reactants from the InitialPhreeqc instance to the reaction-module workers, possibly with mixing. In its simplest form, initial_conditions1 is used to select initial conditions, including solutions and reactants, for each cell of the model, without mixing. Initial_conditions1 is dimensioned (nxyz, 7), where nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model (RM_GetGridCellCount). The dimension of 7 refers to solutions and reactants in the following order: (1) SOLUTIONS, (2) EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES, (3) EXCHANGE, (4) SURFACE, (5) GAS_PHASE, (6) SOLID_SOLUTIONS, and (7) KINETICS. In C, initial_solution1[3*nxyz + 99] = 2, indicates that cell 99 (0 based) contains the SURFACE definition with user number 2 that has been defined in the InitialPhreeqc instance (either by RM_RunFile or RM_RunString).

            It is also possible to mix solutions and reactants to obtain the initial conditions for cells. For mixing, initials_conditions2 contains numbers for a second entity that mixes with the entity defined in initial_conditions1. Fraction1 contains the mixing fraction for initial_conditions1, whereas (1 - fraction1) is the mixing fraction for initial_conditions2. In C, initial_solution1[3*nxyz + 99] = 2, initial_solution2[3*nxyz + 99] = 3, fraction1[3*nxyz + 99] = 0.25 indicates that cell 99 (0 based) contains a mixture of 0.25 SURFACE 2 and 0.75 SURFACE 3, where the surface compositions have been defined in the InitialPhreeqc instance. If the user number in initial_conditions2 is negative, no mixing occurs. If initials_conditions2 and fraction1 are NULL, no mixing is used, and initial conditions are derived solely from initials_conditions1.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                initial_conditions1	Array of solution and reactant index numbers that refer to definitions in the InitialPhreeqc instance. Size is (nxyz,7). The order of definitions is given above. Negative values are ignored, resulting in no definition of that entity for that cell.
                initial_conditions2	Array of solution and reactant index numbers that refer to definitions in the InitialPhreeqc instance. Nonnegative values of initial_conditions2 result in mixing with the entities defined in initial_conditions1. Negative values result in no mixing. Size is (nxyz,7). The order of definitions is given above. May be NULL in C; setting to NULL results in no mixing.
                fraction1	Fraction of initial_conditions1 that mixes with (1-fraction1) of initial_conditions2. Size is (nxyz,7). The order of definitions is given above. May be NULL in C; setting to NULL results in no mixing.

            Runs a reaction step for all of the cells in the reaction module. Normally, tranport concentrations are transferred to the reaction cells (RM_SetConcentrations) before reaction calculations are run. The length of time over which kinetic reactions are integrated is set by RM_SetTimeStep. Other properties that may need to be updated as a result of the transport calculations include porosity (RM_SetPorosity), saturation (RM_SetSaturation), temperature (RM_SetTemperature), and pressure (RM_SetPressure).

The volume of water in a cell is the product of porosity (RM_SetPorosity), saturation (RM_SetSaturation), and reference volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume). The moles of each component are determined by the volume of water and per liter concentrations. If concentration units (RM_SetUnitsSolution) are mass fraction, the density (as specified by RM_SetDensity) is used to convert from mass fraction to per mass per liter.

            Parameters

            %{
            Sets the property for partitioning solids between the saturated and unsaturated parts of a partially saturated cell.

            The option is intended to be used by saturated-only flow codes that allow a variable water table. The value has meaning only when saturations less than 1.0 are encountered. The partially saturated cells may have a small water-to-rock ratio that causes reactions to proceed differently relative to fully saturated cells. By setting RM_SetPartitionUZSolids to true, the amounts of solids and gases are partioned according to the saturation. If a cell has a saturation of 0.5, then the water interacts with only half of the solids and gases; the other half is unreactive until the water table rises. As the saturation in a cell varies, solids and gases are transferred between the saturated and unsaturated (unreactive) reservoirs of the cell. Unsaturated-zone flow and transport codes will probably use the default (false), which assumes all gases and solids are reactive regardless of saturation.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                tf	True, the fraction of solids and gases available for reaction is equal to the saturation; False (default), all solids and gases are reactive regardless of saturation.

                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                por	Array of porosities, unitless. Default is 0.1. Size of array is nxyz, where nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model (RM_GetGridCellCount).

                cell_mask	Array of integers. Size of array is nxyz, where nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model (RM_GetGridCellCount). A value of 0 will disable printing detailed output for the cell; a value of 1 will enable printing detailed output for a cell.

            %{
            Setting to enable or disable printing detailed output from reaction calculations to the output file for a set of cells defined by RM_SetPrintChemistryMask. The detailed output prints all of the output typical of a PHREEQC reaction calculation, which includes solution descriptions and the compositions of all other reactants. The output can be several hundred lines per cell, which can lead to a very large output file (prefix.chem.txt, RM_OpenFiles). For the worker instances, the output can be limited to a set of cells (RM_SetPrintChemistryMask) and, in general, the amount of information printed can be limited by use of options in the PRINT data block of PHREEQC (applied by using RM_RunFile or RM_RunString). Printing the detailed output for the workers is generally used only for debugging, and PhreeqcRM will run significantly faster when printing detailed output for the workers is disabled.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                workers	0, disable detailed printing in the worker instances, 1, enable detailed printing in the worker instances.

        function status = RM_SetRebalanceByCell(obj, method)
            %{
            Set the load-balancing algorithm. PhreeqcRM attempts to rebalance the load of each thread or process such that each thread or process takes the same amount of time to run its part of a RM_RunCells calculation. Two algorithms are available; one uses individual times for each cell and accounts for cells that were not run because saturation was zero (default), and the other assigns an average time to all cells. The methods are similar, but limited testing indicates the default method performs better.

        Parameters
            id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
            method	0, indicates average times are used in rebalancing; 1 indicates individual cell times are used in rebalancing (default).

        function status = RM_SetRebalanceFraction(obj, f)
            %{
            Sets the fraction of cells that are transferred among threads or processes when rebalancing. PhreeqcRM attempts to rebalance the load of each thread or process such that each thread or process takes the same amount of time to run its part of a RM_RunCells calculation. The rebalancing transfers cell calculations among threads or processes to try to achieve an optimum balance. RM_SetRebalanceFraction adjusts the calculated optimum number of cell transfers by a fraction from 0 to 1.0 to determine the actual number of cell transfers. A value of zero eliminates load rebalancing. A value less than 1.0 is suggested to slow the approach to the optimum cell distribution and avoid possible oscillations when too many cells are transferred at one iteration, requiring reverse transfers at the next iteration. Default is 0.5.

        Parameters
            id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
            f	Fraction from 0.0 to 1.0.

        function status = RM_SetRepresentativeVolume(obj, rv)
            %{
            Set the representative volume of each reaction cell. By default the representative volume of each reaction cell is 1 liter. The volume of water in a reaction cell is determined by the procuct of the representative volume, the porosity (RM_SetPorosity), and the saturation (RM_SetSaturation). The numerical method of PHREEQC is more robust if the water volume for a reaction cell is within a couple orders of magnitude of 1.0. Small water volumes caused by small porosities and (or) small saturations (and (or) small representative volumes) may cause non-convergence of the numerical method. In these cases, a larger representative volume may help. Note that increasing the representative volume also increases the number of moles of the reactants in the reaction cell (minerals, surfaces, exchangers, and others), which are defined as moles per representative volume.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                rv	Vector of representative volumes, in liters. Default is 1.0 liter. Size of array is nxyz, where nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model (RM_GetGridCellCount).

        function status = RM_SetSaturation(obj, sat)
            %{
            Set the saturation of each reaction cell. Saturation is a fraction ranging from 0 to 1. The volume of water in a cell is the product of porosity (RM_SetPorosity), saturation (RM_SetSaturation), and representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume). As a result of a reaction calculation, solution properties (density and volume) will change; the databases phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat have the molar volume data to calculate these changes. The methods RM_GetDensity, RM_GetSolutionVolume, and RM_GetSaturation can be used to account for these changes in the succeeding transport calculation. RM_SetRepresentativeVolume should be called before initial conditions are defined for the reaction cells.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                sat	Array of saturations, unitless. Size of array is nxyz, where nxyz is the number of grid cells in the user's model (RM_GetGridCellCount).

            %{
            Set input units for kinetic reactants.

            In PHREEQC input, kinetics are defined by moles of kinetic reactants (Mp). RM_SetUnitsKinetics specifies how the number of moles of kinetic reactants in a reaction cell (Mc) is calculated from the input value (Mp).

            Options are 0, Mp is mol/L of RV (default), Mc = Mp*RV, where RV is the representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume); 1, Mp is mol/L of water in the RV, Mc = Mp*P*RV, where P is porosity (RM_SetPorosity); or 2, Mp is mol/L of rock in the RV, Mc = Mp*(1-P)*RV.

            If a single KINETICS definition is used for cells with different initial porosity, the three options scale quite differently. For option 0, the number of moles of kinetic reactants will be the same regardless of porosity. For option 1, the number of moles of kinetic reactants will be vary directly with porosity and inversely with rock volume. For option 2, the number of moles of kinetic reactants will vary directly with rock volume and inversely with porosity.

            Note that the volume of water in a cell in the reaction module is equal to the product of porosity (RM_SetPorosity), the saturation (RM_SetSaturation), and representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume), which is usually less than 1 liter. It is important to write the RATES definitions for homogeneous (aqueous) kinetic reactions to account for the current volume of water, often by calculating the rate of reaction per liter of water and multiplying by the volume of water (Basic function SOLN_VOL).

            Rates that depend on surface area of solids, are not dependent on the volume of water. However, it is important to get the correct surface area for the kinetic reaction. To scale the surface area with the number of moles, the specific area (m^2 per mole of reactant) can be defined as a parameter (KINETICS; -parm), which is multiplied by the number of moles of reactant (Basic function M) in RATES to obtain the surface area.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                option	Units option for kinetic reactants: 0, 1, or 2.

        function status = RM_SetUnitsPPassemblage(obj, option)

            Options are 0, Mp is mol/L of RV (default), Mc = Mp*RV, where RV is the representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume); 1, Mp is mol/L of water in the RV, Mc = Mp*P*RV, where P is porosity (RM_SetPorosity); or 2, Mp is mol/L of rock in the RV, Mc = Mp*(1-P)*RV.

            If a single EQUILIBRIUM_PHASES definition is used for cells with different initial porosity, the three options scale quite differently. For option 0, the number of moles of a mineral will be the same regardless of porosity. For option 1, the number of moles of a mineral will be vary directly with porosity and inversely with rock volume. For option 2, the number of moles of a mineral will vary directly with rock volume and inversely with porosity.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.

        function status = RM_SetUnitsSolution(obj, option)
            %{
            Solution concentration units used by the transport model. Options are 1, mg/L; 2 mol/L; or 3, mass fraction, kg/kgs. PHREEQC defines solutions by the number of moles of each element in the solution.

            To convert from mg/L to moles of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell, mg/L is converted to mol/L and multiplied by the solution volume, which is the product of porosity (RM_SetPorosity), saturation (RM_SetSaturation), and representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume). To convert from mol/L to moles of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell, mol/L is multiplied by the solution volume. To convert from mass fraction to moles of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell, kg/kgs is converted to mol/kgs, multiplied by density (RM_SetDensity) and multiplied by the solution volume.

            To convert from moles of element in the representative volume of a reaction cell to mg/L, the number of moles of an element is divided by the solution volume resulting in mol/L, and then converted to mg/L. To convert from moles of element in a cell to mol/L, the number of moles of an element is divided by the solution volume resulting in mol/L. To convert from moles of element in a cell to mass fraction, the number of moles of an element is converted to kg and divided by the total mass of the solution. Two options are available for the volume and mass of solution that are used in converting to transport concentrations: (1) the volume and mass of solution are calculated by PHREEQC, or (2) the volume of solution is the product of porosity (RM_SetPorosity), saturation (RM_SetSaturation), and representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume), and the mass of solution is volume times density as defined by RM_SetDensity. Which option is used is determined by RM_UseSolutionDensityVolume.

            Options are 0, Mp is mol/L of RV (default), Mc = Mp*RV, where RV is the representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume); 1, Mp is mol/L of water in the RV, Mc = Mp*P*RV, where P is porosity (RM_SetPorosity); or 2, Mp is mol/L of rock in the RV, Mc = Mp*(1-P)*RV.

            If a single SOLID_SOLUTION definition is used for cells with different initial porosity, the three options scale quite differently.

            Set solution concentrations in the reaction cells based on the vector of aqueous species concentrations (species_conc). This method is intended for use with multicomponent-diffusion transport calculations, and RM_SetSpeciesSaveOn must be set to true. The list of aqueous species is determined by RM_FindComponents and includes all aqueous species that can be made from the set of components. The method determines the total concentration of a component by summing the molarities of the individual species times the stoichiometric coefficient of the element in each species. Solution compositions in the reaction cells are updated with these component concentrations.

            Parameters
                id	The instance id returned from RM_Create.
                species_conc	Array of aqueous species concentrations. Dimension of the array is (nxyz, nspecies), where nxyz is the number of user grid cells (RM_GetGridCellCount), and nspecies is the number of aqueous species (RM_GetSpeciesCount). Concentrations are moles per liter.

Two options are available to convert concentration units: (1) the density and solution volume calculated by PHREEQC are used, or (2) the specified density (RM_SetDensity) and solution volume are defined by the product of saturation (RM_SetSaturation), porosity (RM_SetPorosity), and representative volume (RM_SetRepresentativeVolume). Transport models that consider density-dependent flow will probably use the PHREEQC-calculated density and solution volume (default), whereas transport models that assume constant-density flow will probably use specified values of density and solution volume. Only the following databases distributed with PhreeqcRM have molar volume information needed to accurately calculate density and solution volume: phreeqc.dat, Amm.dat, and pitzer.dat. Density is only used when converting to transport units of mass fraction.

                tf	True indicates that the solution density and volume as calculated by PHREEQC will be used to calculate concentrations.
